  <h3>cheesy, gooey, goodness</h3>

  <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s 
    so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients 
    and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough 
    to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh 
    vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, 
    garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off 
    your way-better-than-takeout creation.
